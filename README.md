# Disclaimer
Use at your own risk.
The source of this project is mostly based on the script currently working on my personal server,
but it is largely fixed for readability and flexibility.
In other words, this project is not tested on the production environment.

# Note
Any pull requests are appreciated, but note that I'm relatively new to GitHub and unfailiar with OSS manner.
